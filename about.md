### About me:

I'm a data scientist at Metis. I am interested in AI and machine learning and eventually hope to use these tools to improve translational medicine (taking research findings and applying them to better treatments and patient outcomes for humans) using big data.

I have a PhD in Neuroscience and Developmental Biology from University of Cambridge. My previous research focused on transcriptomics in developing neuronal populations in the fruit fly equivalent of the spinal cord. My scientific interests are in the interrelated fields of organ regrowth, regenerative medicine, gene therapies, and stem cell therapies.

Between getting my PhD and becoming a data science teaching assistant at Metis, I worked for 9 months on a team of internal contractor research specialists (mostly PhDs) at Howard Hughes Medical Institute. We were given timelines and budgets for multiple different projects that were driven by the needs of each lab. I built data analysis pipelines for multiple labs and shared results with them iteratively. I also revived deprecated analysis pipelines. These analyses were predominantly for genomics and computer vision.

I'm actively job searching. Please check out my [resume](https://jack-etheredge.github.io/resume.html) if you're hiring.
