### More Information

I'm a data scientist at Metis. I am interested in AI and machine learning and eventually hope to use these tools to improve translational medicine (taking research findings and applying them to better treatments and patient outcomes for humans) using big data. I have a PhD in Neuroscience and Developmental Biology from University of Cambridge. My previous research focused on transcriptomics in developing neuronal populations in the fruit fly equivalent of the spinal cord. My scientific interests are in the interrelated fields of organ regrowth, regenerative medicine, gene therapies, and stem cell therapies.
