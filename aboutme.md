title: About Me
subtitle: Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist in New York City
---

My name is Jack Etheredge. I'm currently a senior machine learning engineer at Twosense.ai.

Previously I was a senior machine learning engineer at American Express, where I performed deep learning research and developed and deployed machine learning powered software while mentoring junior team members. 

I particularly enjoy machine learning research opportunities that focus on addressing human health and environmental conservation problems.

I earned a PhD from the University of Cambridge in neuroscience for work describing gene expression patterns in developing neuronal stem cells lineages.

### Areas of interest:
- Sustainability, climate, conservation
- Human health
- Social bias (and removing it from models)
- Machine learning
  * model efficiency
  * active learning
  * data augmentation

### Technical skills (machine learning):
- Python
- Machine learning
- Deep learning
- Natural language processing (NLP)
- Computer vision 

### Purpose of this blog:

The purpose of this blog is to showcase some of the projects I've done, but also to teach machine learning through examples and tutorials. Eventually I plan to discuss foundational machine learning papers here also.
