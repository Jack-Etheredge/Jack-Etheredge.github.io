The issue with learning machine learning or Python or data science these days isn't that there aren't enough resources. The problem is that there are so many resources that you can spend longer on comparing the different books and videos and courses than it would have taken to get a working proficiency.

Here are some of the best resources for machine learning and math:

1. Statquest (probability, statistics, machine learning)
2. 3Blue1Brown (deep learning, linear algebra, calculus)
3. deeplearning.ai (deep learning)
4. fast.ai (tree-based machine learning models and deep learning)
5. [Mathematics for Machine Learning - Imperial College London](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning) (linear algebra, multivariate calculus)
6. RealPython (Python from beginner to advanced, computer science)
